Title: Advanced Techniques for Ecological Niche Modeling Made Easy
Version: 0.3.6
Author: Neander M. Heming, Cristian Dambros, Eliecer E. Gutierrez
Maintainer: Neander Marcel Heming <neanderh@yahoo.com.br>
Description: This package provides tools to facilitate the use of advanced
    techiques related to Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) and the automation of
    repetitive tasks (model multiple species). The package provides functions
    for easier: 1. preparation of occurrence and environmental data; 2. model tunning
    (thanks to the package ENMeval); 3. model fitting and projection; 4. threshold 
    application, and; 5. computation of basic model and projection metrics 
    for results reporting. 
    ENMwizard also provides methods described in GutiÃ©rrez & Heming in prep. 
    See 'readme' file in https://github.com/HemingNM/ENMwizard for a brief tutorial.
