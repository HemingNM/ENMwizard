Title: Advanced Techniques for Ecological Niche Modeling Made Easy
Version: 0.4.2
Author: Neander M. Heming, Cristian Dambros, Eliecer E. Gutierrez
Maintainer: Neander Marcel Heming <neanderh@yahoo.com.br>
Description: This package provides tools to facilitate the use of advanced
    techiques related to Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) and the
    automation of repetitive tasks (model multiple species). The package
    provides functions for easier: 1. preparation of occurrence and
    environmental data; 2. model tunning (thanks to the package ENMeval);
    3. model fitting and projection; 4. consensual projections 5.
    threshold application; 6. mask application on thresholded projections,
    and; 7. computation of basic model and projection metrics for results
    reporting.  ENMwizard also provides methods described in GutiÃ©rrez &
    Heming in prep.  See 'readme' file in
    https://github.com/HemingNM/ENMwizard for a brief tutorial.
