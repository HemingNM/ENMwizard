Title: Advanced Tecniques for Ecological Niche Modeling Made Easy
Version: 0.3.0
Author: Neander M. Heming, Cristian Dambros, Eliecer E. Gutierrez
Maintainer: Neander Marcel Heming <neanderh@yahoo.com.br>
Description: This package provides tools to facilitate the use of advanced
    techiques related to Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) and the automation of
    repetitive tasks (when modeling several species). This package has functions
    for easier: 1. preparation of occurence and environmental data; 2. model tunning
    (thanks to the package ENMeval); 3. model fitting and projection. ENMwizard also
    implements methods described in GutiÃ©rrez & Heming in prep. See 'readme' file in
    https://github.com/HemingNM/ENMwizard for a brief tutorial.
