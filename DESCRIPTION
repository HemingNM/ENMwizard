Description: This package provides tools to facilitate the use of advanced techiques related to ENM and the automation of repetitive tasks (when modelling several species). This package has functions to enable easier: 1. preparation of occurence and environmental data used in ENM, 2. model tunning (thanks to ENMeval), 3. model fitting and projection. ENMwizard also implements methods described in Gutierrez & Heming in prep. See readme in https://github.com/HemingNM/ENMwizard for a brief tutorial.
